# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. Over the past few weeks, I have built several models to solve real-world problems. Here are the projects included in this repository:

## Projects

### 1. Diabetes Prediction
Developed a model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health indicators, achieving high accuracy and providing valuable insights into patient health.

### 2. Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
Created a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs using demographic and health-related data, helping to understand cost drivers and predict expenses.

### 3. Gold Price Prediction using ANN
Implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to forecast gold prices, incorporating historical data and economic indicators for more accurate predictions.

### 4. Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
Leveraged Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices, demonstrating the power of advanced time-series analysis for financial forecasting.

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Built a robust model to detect fraudulent transactions, addressing class imbalance and improving security for financial institutions.

Feel free to explore each project. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
